## Kurizu itz me
Website showcasing my projects and other stuff.
Its basically a clone of how discord desktop app looks but in a website 

## Code
Just clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
Then run `npm run dev` to start the server

All the code is in the `src/components` folder under 3 main folders:
- `channels`: contains all the channels related stuff
- `content`: the main page content
- `sidebar`: sidebar for servers 

If you have any feedback / bugs / suggestions, feel free to open an issue on github or contact me on discord.
